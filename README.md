# To Do List

* Obtain a reseller's license
    * Call State Board of Equalization in Salinas and tell them: 1) I am planning on starting an online jewelry business. 2) I live in Santa Cruz.
    * This is so tax isn't collected twice

* Website
    * Take all new photos
        * People are interested in seeing the jewelry, not ears
        * Extreme close-ups
        * Give a pretty model free jewelry/cash in trade for a photo shoot


# Notes

* In CA when someone from CA buys an item the seller has to pay sales tax to the state

* Book Keeping
    * Expenses include tools, cost of materials, shipping, etc.
