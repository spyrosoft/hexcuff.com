						<h1>The Invention Of The Hex Cuff</h1>
						<div class="italics">
							<p>One day a young man decided he wanted an ear cuff.</p>
							<p>He typed "buy ear cuffs" into Google image search.</p>
							<p>Digging, digging, and digging some more through the results, he became increasingly dissatisfied.</p>
							<p>There were endless beautiful ear cuffs, but none which would work for him.</p>
							<p>He considered what each of the ear cuffs he had seen had in common.</p>
							<p>It occurred to him that hex nuts are already the correct shape.</p>
							<p>If he removed one of the sides, the Hex Cuff should do well at attaching to his ear on its own.</p>
							<p>He ventured out on a quest to the Hardware Store.</p>
							<p>He picked out a few hex nuts to test his hypothesis.</p>
							<p>He successfully battled and tamed his first Hex Cuff.</p>
							<p>It worked better than he had dreamed.</p>
							<p>He ventured out again, this time far and wide, in search of new types of hex nuts.</p>
							<p>Thus, Hex Cuffs were born unto the world.</p>
